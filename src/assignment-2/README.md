# Assignment 2
Create an efficient EV charging system that balances demand and charger supply whilst minimising wait times.

## System Setting
* You are an EV charging provider of 12 charging stations in cities (1 station per city) along the route from Sydney to Melbourne;
* Each station is equipped with varying number of chargers allowing multiple vehicles to charge concurrently;
* A EV seeking to charge must initiate a charge request with the provider;
* The system handles all incoming **demand** within a specified timeframe. 
* The demand is randomly generated by a `demandGenerator` class;
* The system then evaluates each request and assigns a charging station to each EV based on the requesting EVs:
	* Starting point
	* Destination
	* Battery Capacity
	* Current State of Charge or SoC (battery left %)
* Ideally, the system should ensure that every EV can travel to its destination with sufficient power whilst minimising overall wait time of EVs.
## Assumptions
* All EVs start at Sydney and exit to a city along the M31 route to Melbourne. So, the default origin of all EVs is Sydney, except when they pause for charging at a city along the route;
* Each city has 1 charging station, allowing us to associate a city with a charging station;
* An EV may need to recharge multiple times to reach its destination;
* However, if its remaining battery is sufficient, then no charge will be allocated;
* Once an EV is charged, its battery level will be back to full capacity;
* Each charging takes half and hour, irrespective of amount to charge to full capacity;
* Individual EV does not have the autonomy to select their charging stations;
